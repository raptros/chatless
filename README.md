# chatless
A connectionless, RESTful chat api.

## What is chatless?
- It's birch, except we're starting by doing chat and implementing everything on top of that.
- A giant distributed truck that you _can_ just dump things on.
- The social network system for the paranoid on the go.

## Why?
- It should be easy to participate in encrypted chat while switching between mobile and full clients.
- And anyway, why should you need blogs or email or forums or chatrooms?
- Just use chatless.

## What does it do?
- tells the client "deal with encryption yourself, jackass!"
- allows you to create, join, and send messages to topics. 
- also lets you watch what other users do (and send them requests).
- collects events for clients to query, and also forward those events to other servers.
